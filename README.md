Welcome! This is a game that is a top down 2D dungeon crawler with a mix of both combat and puzzle solving. The goal of this project is to gain experience using the Unity Engine as it was many of our first times using it. 

This game, which is still far from finished, is a culmination of us developers trying our hand at creating a game with the experience and resources we have.


## About the Game
A lot of the focus for this project was building our game development experience. Therefore, we used a variety of  free assets to complete our project. The most notable resources included: A variety of free sprite assets available in the Unity Asset Store, most notably [The Cainos](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/pixel-art-top-down-basic-187605) sprite package, the RF Castle Sprite Package, and the TextMesh Pro mod.

We also had a developer create our own sprites to add to the game, which gave us the experience of importing our own assets and learning how to work with them in Unity.
